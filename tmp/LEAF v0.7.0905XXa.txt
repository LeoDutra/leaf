Optimizations and fixes


NEEDS:

	- test before commit
	- fix semantics (o, e, k, etc)
	- try optimization using childNodes on DOM.getByTag
	- research for more versions of aX to DOM.buildxml
	- DOMElement.getOffset, cannot reference offsetParent on IE6 elements before append (an error strikes)
	- JSON handler
	- research currentStyle (IE/OP) and window.getComputedStyle(e, null)(FF/OP) use when getting style property null for common style (<element>.style)



OBS:

	- instanceof is faster than o.constructor ===
	- function.apply(this, arguments) is slower than function.call, that is slower than set each attribute with this
	  (apply > call > object.property)
	- use 15ms as minimum delay for setTimeout e setInterval when animating
